# new site

Welcome to words. I'd serve plain, boring and ugly `.txt` files were I able. I am not. For your convenience, the page is centered. I await thanks from your neck.

I must also confess that each page has an embedded favicon which is quite obese; weighing a whopping 105 bytes. Send all complaints to /dev/null. base64-gif-goodness.

This is my little corner where I will speak my mind. There will be no comments, rss feed, analytics, javascript or what have you. I don't care for readership numbers nor do I care for you.

Nothing will be dated for time has no place here. I will publish words. Heed them, read them or don't. If you are in Russia, the 3rd applies seeing as the host is blocked there.

I am always me and you are always you. For those who know the I behind the me, best you keep it so. For those who discern it, welcome to the club.

Because try as you might to fight it, you know you love me. 

XOXO
