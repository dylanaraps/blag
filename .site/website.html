Readability and Accessibility are its primary goals. There is no <code>javascript</code>, animation, <code>webgl</code>, analytics, tracking or <em>insert web technology here</em>. It is just <code>html</code>, minimal <code>css</code> and sometimes images.<p>This website is written in markdown and is statically generated using a <code>bash</code> script. A page load (<em>without images</em>) is only a single <code>http</code> request. The build script (<em>minus image minification</em>) runs in under <code>10ms</code> and can easily be run inside of a loop to mimic <code>jekyll serve</code> functionality.<p>The build process looks like this:<ol type=1><li>Convert <code>md</code> files to <code>html</code>.<li>Insert generated <code>html</code> into the template.<li>Minify the resulting <code>html</code> file.<li>Save it to <code>.site/</code>.</ol><p>The <code>css</code> is as minimal and as generic as possible while still providing a fully responsive layout. It is so tiny it is faster to inline it on every page than to load it from an external file. There are no classes and <code>html</code> tags themselves are styled.<p>There is zero <code>javascript</code> here nor analytics or tracking. It is not needed. I do not care how many people visit my website. Nor should you.<p>No web fonts are used. The <code>css</code> just sets <code>font-family: sans-serif</code> resulting in your systemâ€™s default fonts being used. I do not have some mystical design vision which requires 7 different downloadable fonts.<p>I do not care for <code>favicons</code>. However, not including one slows down your website, as modern browsers make network requests for <code>favicons</code> even if they are not present in the <code>html</code>. I work around this by setting the favicon to the smallest possible <code>base64</code> encoded <code>png</code>.<pre><code>&lt;link href=&quot;data:image/png;base64,&quot; rel=icon type=&quot;image/png&quot;&gt;</code></pre><p>Images are provided in two different sizes. One size to match the <code>max-width</code> of the content and a second size (<em>which is twice as large</em>) for High-DPI displays. I also provide two different image formats, <code>webp</code> and <code>jpg</code>/<code>png</code> as a fallback if the former is unsupported.<p>The source is available on my GitHub account, here: <a href=https://github.com/dylanaraps/blag>website source</a></main>
