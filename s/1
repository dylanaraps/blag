# new site

Welcome to words. I'd serve plain, boring and ugly `.txt` files were I able. I am not. For your convenience, the page is centered. I await thanks from your neck.

I must also confess that each page has an embedded favicon which is quite obese; weighing a whopping 105 bytes. Send all complaints to /dev/null.
