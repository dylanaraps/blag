The distribution will not provide binary packages and users will need to compile the software through the provided package manager.<p>The system will run <code>busybox</code>. Using its <code>coreutils</code>, <code>init</code> and <code>shell</code>. The package manager will be written in POSIX <code>sh</code> and linted accordingly with <code>shellcheck</code>.<p><code>musl</code> will be used as the system’s <code>libc</code> and packages which cannot be built without <code>glibc</code> will outright not be provided. Software which can be built with <code>musl</code> using minor patches will be packaged.<p>Proprietary software will not be packaged either and binary blobs will be removed from the provided kernel. You can make packages for these yourself if needed.<p>Web browsers will by default build with all telemetry disabled. As an alternative to Firefox/Chromium; Smaller browsers like Otter Browser and Falkon will also be packaged.<h2 id=information>Information</h2><ul><li><a href=#what-kind-of-release-schedule-is-expected>What kind of release schedule is expected?</a><li><a href=#why-shell-scripts>Why shell scripts?</a><li><a href=#where-will-package-build-scripts-be-stored>Where will package build scripts be stored?</a><li><a href=#will-binaries-be-offered-for-firefoxchromium>Will binaries be offered for Firefox/Chromium?</a><li><a href=#what-about-etcmachine-id>What about <code>/etc/machine-id</code>?</a><li><a href=#packages-in-base>Packages in <code>base</code>.</a><li><a href=#hierarchy>Hierarchy</a></ul><h3 id=what-kind-of-release-schedule-is-expected>What kind of release schedule is expected?</h3><p>The distribution will be of the rolling release kind. Packages will be updated as soon as they are available (<em>keeping in mind minor testing in case things go awry</em>). That being said, this is a compile-your-own-packages type of distribution so the choice is ultimately up to you.<h3 id=why-shell-scripts>Why shell scripts?</h3><p>Writing the package manager (<em>and some miscellaneous programs</em>) as shell scripts will increase development time while also providing first class support for a <code>PKGBUILD</code>/<code>APKBUILD</code> alternative.<p>The shell scripts will all be linted with <code>shellcheck</code> and have to pass through me before they hit the distribution. Shell scripts are my forte and the majority of my projects are written in <code>bash</code> or <code>sh</code>.<p>See: <a href=https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch>neofetch</a>, <a href=https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff>fff</a>, <a href=https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible>pure bash bible</a><h3 id=where-will-package-build-scripts-be-stored>Where will package build scripts be stored?</h3><p>The package build scripts will be stored in a <code>git</code> repository on GitHub and the issue tracker will be used for issues and pull requests.<h3 id=will-binaries-be-offered-for-firefoxchromium>Will binaries be offered for Firefox/Chromium?</h3><p>This is on my radar. Nobody is currently offering pre-built <code>musl</code> binaries for any of the major web browsers. If we go this route, I will ensure the binaries also run correctly on Alpine Linux and other <code>musl</code> distributions.<p>The browsers will be built with all telemetry disabled as both Firefox and Chromium disrespect the user’s privacy by default. For Chromium this will most likely entail the usage of <code>ungoogled-chromium</code> in Chromium’s place.<h3 id=what-about-etcmachine-id>What about <code>/etc/machine-id</code>?</h3><p>The <code>/etc/machine-id</code> file is a new FreeDesktop standard to provide a unique identifier for every Linux system. The idea originally started in <code>dbus</code> but has now become a generic <code>uuid</code>.<p>Firefox outright refuses to launch if this file is not present or it does not contain a valid <code>uuid</code>. The same is happening with more and more software.<p>This is a privacy concern to me and this file will not be used in the traditional sense. The solution will be to create this file at boot with a zeroed <code>uuid</code>. This goes against the standard and also prevents the file from being used to identify you.<p>Example zeroed <code>/etc/machine-id</code> file:<pre><code>00000000000000000000000000000000</code></pre><p>The distro, <a href=https://devuan.org/>Devuan</a> will use a similar solution and there has been talk in the <a href=https://www.gentoo.org/>Gentoo</a> forums about possible alternative solutions.
