I supplicate for thy control;
The spirit of self-sacrifice;
And in the light of truth thy milkman let me live!

Cows laugh before thee on their beds
And fragrance in thy footing treads;
The spirit of self-sacrifice
And the most ancient heavens, through methane, are fresh and strong.

Live in the spirit of this creed;
And oft, when in my heart was heard
When empty terrors overawe;
Thou want milk that is raw
</code></pre></main>
