# Openbox depends on rust

Openbox, which has not seen a release or line of code in over 3 years \[0\] now depends on `rust`. This occurred due to one of the dependencies (*librsvg*) being rewritten in `rust` \[1\].

I find it really odd that software which has been untouched for years can suddenly depend on an additional dependency to build.
