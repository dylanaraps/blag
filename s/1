# new site

Welcome to s1x. I'd serve plain, boring and ugly `.txt` files were I able. I am not. For your convenience, the page is centered. I await thanks from your neck.

This is my little corner where I will speak my mind. There will be no comments, rss feed, analytics, javascript or what have you. I don't care for readership numbers nor do I care for you.

Nothing will be dated for time has no place here. I will publish words. Heed them, read them or don't. If you are in Russia, the 3rd applies seeing as the host is blocked there.

Because try as you might to fight it, you know you love me.
