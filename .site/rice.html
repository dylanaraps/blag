The only GUI application which runs is the web browser. The rest of the system is controlled and used through the terminal.<pre><code>    ___      black@bones

Colors are extracted from the current wallpaper and are changed system-wide and on-the-fly.<p><picture> <source srcset="/images/rice1-2x.webp 2x,/images/rice1.webp" type=image/webp><source srcset="/images/rice1-2x.jpg 2x, /images/rice1.jpg" type=image/jpeg><img src=/images/rice1.jpg alt=desktop></picture><p>The system information tool I use is a program I wrote called <a href=https://github.com/dylanaraps><code>neofetch</code></a>. The <code>bar</code> is a simple <a href=https://github.com/dylanaraps/bin/blob/master/bar>shell script</a> which fetches information from text files at an interval. As there is no method to obtain the volume level from a file, I populate a file whenever I change the volume level.<p>The bar loops infinitely without executing a single command. The device has an SSD. There is zero performance impact on file IO.<p><picture> <source srcset="/images/rice2-2x.webp 2x,/images/rice2.webp" type=image/webp><source srcset="/images/rice2-2x.jpg 2x, /images/rice2.jpg" type=image/jpeg><img src=/images/rice2.jpg alt=desktop></picture><p>My text editor is <code>vim</code> using the <code>goyo</code> plugin to hide the user interface and center the file’s contents. The music player is <code>mpv</code> running inside of my local music library. I do not need a fancy program to provide a library, playlists and metadata.<p>The big upside to <code>mpv</code> is that my video player, image viewer and music player are all the same program. The configuration is unified between the three and the hotkeys are all the same.<p><picture> <source srcset="/images/rice3-2x.webp 2x,/images/rice3.webp" type=image/webp><source srcset="/images/rice3-2x.jpg 2x, /images/rice3.jpg" type=image/jpeg><img src=/images/rice3.jpg alt=desktop></picture><p>I talk primarily over Discord using the <code>IRCdiscord</code> program to allow connection via an IRC client. The client I use is <code>weechat</code> with majority of its user interface disabled.<p>This is a great combination as it avoids running another web browser to access their client and it uses near zero resources. I would love to swap to bare IRC or Matrix in the future as Discord does not respect the user’s privacy.<p><picture> <source srcset="/images/rice4-2x.webp 2x,/images/rice4.webp" type=image/webp><source srcset="/images/rice4-2x.jpg 2x, /images/rice4.jpg" type=image/jpeg><img src=/images/rice4.jpg alt=desktop></picture><p>Resource usage is extremely low and time on battery is extremely high. I would love to move to something even lighter in the future. Alpine Linux has its positives however it has its negatives too.<p>Packages are not updated in a timely manner and the project suffers from a lack of maintainers/developers. I do not use <code>dbus</code> and there is a mix between packages built with it explicitly disabled and those built with it as a dependency.<p><picture> <source srcset="/images/rice5-2x.webp 2x,/images/rice5.webp" type=image/webp><source srcset="/images/rice5-2x.jpg 2x, /images/rice5.jpg" type=image/jpeg><img src=/images/rice5.jpg alt=desktop></picture><p>I would love to swap windows managers in the near future. Openbox has not seen an update or line of code in over 3 years and I like to keep things “fresh”. Despite this fact, Openbox as of the last 3 months now depends on <code>rust</code> to build.<p>This occurred due to one of the dependencies being rewritten in <code>rust</code>. It’s funny how a program that has not seen an update in years can suddenly depend on additional or different software.<hr><p>Sources:<ul><li><code>dotfiles</code>: <a href=https://github.com/dylanaraps/dotfiles class=uri>https://github.com/dylanaraps/dotfiles</a><li><code>scripts</code>: <a href=https://github.com/dylanaraps/bin class=uri>https://github.com/dylanaraps/bin</a></ul><br></main></section>
